  abstract	= {We present the generic system framework of Isabelle/Isar
		  underlying recent versions of Isabelle. Among other things,
		  Isar provides an infrastructure for Isabelle plug-ins,
		  comprising extensible state components and extensible
		  syntax that can be bound to tactical ML programs. Thus the
		  Isabelle/Isar architecture may be understood as an
		  extension and refinement of the traditional ``LCF
		  approach'', with explicit infrastructure for building
		  derivative systems. To demonstrate the technical potential
		  of the framework, we apply it to a concrete formal methods
		  tool: the HOL-Z 3.0 environment, which is geared towards
		  the analysis of Z specifications and formal proof of
		  forward-refinements.},
